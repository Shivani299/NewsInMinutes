            <p style="font-size:15px">China and Russia are challenging the military supremacy of America and its allies and the West can no longer rely on the strategic advantage it has enjoyed until now, a leading think tank states in its annual report.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">The Military Balance 2018 report, produced by the IISS (International Institute of Strategic Studies) warns that while war between the great powers is not inevitable, Washington, Moscow and Beijing are now systematically preparing for the possibility of conflict.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">“China’s emerging weapons developments and broader defence-technological progress further its transition from ‘catching up’ with the West to becoming a global defence innovator. The West no longer has a monopoly on world-leading defence innovation and production, or the funds to enable these. Indeed, China might be the one to leap ahead. But to use its capabilities to best effect, China will need to make similar improvements in training, doctrine and tactics.”</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">Donald Trump has threatened to withhold billions of dollars in aid from those nations which criticise his controversial decision to unilaterally recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

In a raising of the stakes over the US’s move to recognise Jerusalem and shift its embassy there - something long requested by Israel and their conservative supporters in the US - Mr Trump said he could penalise those countries that voted against the move at the UN.

Previously, the US’s UN Ambassador Niki Haley had warned the US would would be “taking names” of any countries who supported a resolution criticising Washington’s actions. A vote is scheduled to take place on Thursday after the US on Monday vetoed a vote by the UN Security Council that would have demanded Mr Trump reverse his decision.

</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Speaking to members of his cabinet on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he liked what Ms Haley had spelled out. “For all these nations, they take our money and then vote against us. They take hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,” Mr Trump said. </p>

            <img src="politics3.jpg"  style="width:100%;height:450px ;padding-left:200px ; padding-right: 200px" alt="Third Slide">
            <p style="font-size:15px">Global sales of weapons and military services have risen for the first time in five years, helped in part by an increase in sales by British companies. 

Weapons – many of which are fuelling deadly conflicts in the Middle East – are now being bought and sold at the highest level since 2010, with sales up more than a third (38 per cent) since 2002.

Military kit worth $374.8bn (£280bn) was sold in 2016 by the industry’s top 100 companies, an annual review by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) found. </p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Sipri’s Siemon Wezeman said Seoul was “aiming to realise its goal of becoming a major arms exporter”.

The Swedish institute said the latest figures revealed the first year of growth among the world’s top 100 arms sales after five consecutive years of decline.Commenting on today’s statistics, Dr Benedict Wilkinson of the Policy Institute at King’s College London said: “This is a clear indication of states responding to what they perceive to be a more volatile and uncertain world.

“To a degree, states are beginning to look at the International System with more caution and more concern and are seeking to allay that by procuring more high tech equipment and material."</p>
