            <p style="font-size:15px">“The Walking Dead” suffered its lowest midseason premiere ratings in the show’s history.

Nielsen Live + Same Day reported the AMC drama, which is in its eighth season, had a 3.6 ratings in adults 18-49 with 8.3 million total viewers on Sunday. The numbers represent the lowest midseason premiere in the show's history, Variety reported.

However, viewership was slightly up from the show’s December midseason finale, which earned a 3.4 ratings in adults and 7.9 million total viewers.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Even with dismal midseason premiere numbers, the popular zombie-killing drama remained the top show on television Sunday. The episode beat out the Pyeongchang Olympics Closing Ceremony on NBC, according to Deadline.</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">Legendary comic book writer Stan Lee was reportedly robbed of $1.4 million and revealed he's currently ill with pneumonia.

TMZ reported detectives arrived at Lee’s Hollywood Hills home Friday to discuss the reported robbery.

Lee has discovered money missing from his account recently. In December, Lee filed a police report after $350,000 apparently disappeared from his bank account. The next month, Lee claimed $850,000 was stolen from him by someone who was trying to buy a condo.

Lee, 95, revealed Wednesday he is battling pneumonia. TMZ reported the former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief had to cancel upcoming events due to the illness.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">“I want you all to know I’m thinking of you, of course I always think of the fans, and I hope you’re all doing well, and I miss you all," Lee said. “I miss your enthusiasm, I miss all your notes, all your photos and emails… and I want you to know that I still love you all.”

Last month, Lee was rushed to the hospital after having shortness of breath and an irregular heartbeat.

            <p style="font-size:15px">Demi Lovato brought survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting onstage during her San Diego concert this week.

Six students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who survived the Feb. 14 attack that killed 17 people, shared the stage with Lovato on Monday night in the first concert of her Tell Me You Love Me World Tour, the New York Daily News reported.

“I want to make sure their voices are being heard and we can provide them with the mental health and post trauma care they need,” Lovato said in statement.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">The students -- Julius Castillo, Mackenzie Marie Chapman, Samantha Megan Deitsch, Maia Hebron, Eden Hebron and Sarah Stricker -- wore maroon shirts that said “MSD Strong” in bold white letters, the report said.

"These are the brave survivors who are working with us to heal their community," the pop singer said onstage, 10 News San Diego reported.

The 25-year-old vocalist sang "Warrior" and said the show was "incredibly special" in a statement.

“It was such an honor to meet them and hear their courageous stories," she said.

She urged fans to donate to the CAST Foundation, a non-profit organization part of CAST (Comprehensive Assistance Support Treatment) Centers for mental health and wellness; she said the money would go to support students in Florida, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

She also hosted a CAST on Tour pre-concert group therapy session with the MSD shooting survivors, the newspaper reported. </p>
