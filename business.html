      <p style="font-size:15px">Growth in China's manufacturing sector in February cooled to the weakest in over 1-1/2 years, raising concerns of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy this year as regulators tighten the screws on financial risks.

The weakness was driven by disruption of business activity due to the Lunar New Year holidays and curbs to factory output from tougher pollution rules, but there are worries of a bigger loss in momentum.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">"Although a recovery looks possible in the short-run as the anti-pollution campaign winds down, the risk is still that the economy fares worse this year than is generally expected," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Wednesday fell to 50.3 in February, from 51.3 in January. But it remained just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis - the 19th straight month of expansion.

The sharper drop, however, may raise some concerns for China's leaders as they prepare for the start of the National People's Congress (NPC) next week where Beijing will unveil its economic targets for this year.</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">The firm says the new techniques will reduce chemical use and make the way in which jeans are faded, distressed and ripped more efficient.

By replacing manual labour with lasers, Levi's will be able to finish a pair of jeans every 90 seconds, instead of just two to three pairs an hour.

It expects the new finishing method to be fully in place by 2020.

Levi's said the new process is less "labour intensive" and will help the company be more responsive to local markets. The methods enable the firm to produce just a few kinds of jeans in bulk, quickly tailoring the finishes to buyer demands.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Chip Bergh, president and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co, called the process "the future of jeans manufacturing."

The firm relies on overseas contractors to make the vast majority of its products.

But a spokeswoman for Levi's says the company does not expect any job losses "in the near-term", because employees can be retrained and put to work in other areas.

"Given the growth of our business with our vendors, we've seen that our manufacturing partners have generally been able to redeploy any affected workers," she said.</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are going to hold a crucial meeting with the Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers of 14 Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states. The Meeting will start at 4 PM on 28th February.

Such Chief Ministers Council meetings, which have become a tradition since PM Modi rose to power in 2014. As per a statement issued to press by MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the issue of simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls would also be discussed.

It is not the first occasion when this kind of gathering is taking place. A meeting was held in April last year. However, the meeting this year looks important as a number of issues ahead of Lok Sabha elections are likely to be discussed.

Along with routine strategies relating to polls, discussions regarding the implementation of various Central and state development schemes, and measures to expedite them are likely to come up during the meet. Meeting may see discussion around Jan-Dhan, Mudra, Ujjwala, and housing schemes, reports India Today.

Highlighting the significance of the meet, the party has sent a five-point note to its functionaries and asked them to come prepared for the meeting. The chief ministers and their staff have been asked to present the status of implementation of Central schemes targeting the poor, IANS reports.</p>
