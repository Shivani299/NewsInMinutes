            <p style="font-size:15px">Miami International Airport (MIA) has become the first major US airport to implement facial recognition technology with an eye towards shortening passport check time for visitors arriving from abroad.
</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">The new technology can screen as many as 10 passengers per minute, said MIA authorities in a statement.
MIA -- one of the country's main international air hubs -- thus becomes the first airport in the country to install a system fully dedicated to providing expedited passport screening via facial recognition technology.
</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Meanwhile, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez said that the enhancement will "improve the international arrival experience for visitors".</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">With Indian industry calling for adopting hi-tech control systems to check financial frauds, a foreign data protection expert has suggested that blockchain technology be used to prevent scams like the one unearthed in Punjab National Bank.
"Blockchain is the underlying technology of Bitcoin (and other crytocurrencies) which gets its name from the mathematical representations of blocks of transaction data, chained together to guarantee immutability of stored information," Russian born Singaporean businessman, Serguei Beloussov told IANS in an interview.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">The Indian government has sounded an alarm likening cryptocurrencies to Ponzi schemes designed to dupe gullible investors. However, experts advise that the technology undelying such cryptocurrencies can be put to good use. The benefits of Blockchain for users include those of "data unmutability, verifiability, security and privacy," Beloussov said.
The Rs 12,600 crore scam in state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) in the Nirav Modi case involved using letters of undertaking (LoUs) which were issued in favour of the accused by bank employees who misused their access to PNB's SWIFT -- the electronic messaging system used for overseas funds transfers. None of these fraudulent transactions were registered on the bank's internal transaction messaging system, the Core Banking Solution (CBS), enabling the fraud to go undetected for long.
While standard encryption is applicable to messages sent via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), the system is not infallible and is vulnerable to hacking, according to Beloussov, chairman of the Russian Quantum Center (RQC), and Co-founder and Chief Executive of Acronis, a data protection multinational headquartered in Singapore.
Besides cryptocurrencies, Beloussov, pointed to smart contracts as another growing area of blockchain application. "Many blockchain implementations now include smart contracts as part of the platform," he said.
"It allows storing computer code in the blockchain that could act on any digital assets recorded on the platform, verify that specified contractual conditions are met and automatically perform or roll-back transactions with these digital assets," he added.
Blockchain technology allows entrepreneurs to incorporate their businesses on a digital distributed ledger, removing intermediaries in traditional processes and reducing friction, he said.
"In tomorrow's digital world, these assets do not have to be purely monetary. It could be education record and certificates, company structure and governance or simply your digital identity that could be portable between banks and corporations and yet remain private and secure," he said.

While blockchain secures data with traditional digital signatures, the Russian Quantum Centre (RQC) has taken a step ahead into the future by developing quantum communications or quantum cryptography, to secure systems against the threat posed by quantum computers.
While a normal computer makes calculations sequentially, one at a time, a quantum computer would be able to process information simultaneously, thus making it much more powerful.

            <img src="technology3.jpg"  style="width:100%;height:450px ;padding-left:200px ; padding-right: 200px" alt="Third Slide">
            <p style="font-size:15px">Indian mobile carrier Aircel Ltd has filed for bankruptcy, it said on Wednesday, pressured by a high debt pile and mounting losses following a price war triggered by a telecom upstart.
Talks between Aircel, 74% owned by Malaysia's Maxis Communications Bhd, and Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) to combine their wireless operations ended late 2017 due to regulatory and legal uncertainties, and interventions by various parties.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Aircel said it had decided to pursue a resolution under the country's Bankruptcy Code as the "appropriate recourse."
The entry of Reliance Jio in 2016 with free voice and cut-price data plans forced smaller operators to exit the crowded and competitive telecoms market, while bigger players such as Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group Plc's Indian unit are merging to stave off competition.</p>
