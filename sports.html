            <p style="font-size:15px">The Laureus Sports Awards website crashed moments after Roger Federer was awarded with the Sportsman of the Year and Comeback of the Year awards at Monaco on Tuesday.

According to a ATP World Tour statement, the Laureas website crashed temporarily after Federer did a historic double in Monaco.


 Federer won his fifth and sixth Laureus statuettes and became the most decorated winner in the awards' history.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">"Roger Federer was honoured by the 2018 Laureus World Sports Awards on Tuesday, picking up the Sportsman of the Year and Comeback of the Year awards at the ceremony in Monaco. The 36-year-old tennis star managed to briefly crash the Laureus website in the process as fans flocked online to read about his win," said the ATP statement.

Recently, Federer won the Rotterdam Open to become the oldest world No.1 in the history of tennis while his long-time rival Rafael Nadal is sidelined with injury.</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">Real Madrid's reliance on their talisman Cristiano Ronaldo was more evident than ever on Tuesday as the Spanish and European champions meekly lost 1-0 at Espanyol in La Liga.

It was Real's first defeat by the Catalans in 11 years after the latest in a long line of insipid displays without Ronaldo that highlight how important the evergreen 33-year-old - who has scored 12 goals in his last seven appearances - is to the side.

After being sent off and suspended for five games after pushing the referee during Real's 3-1 victory over Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup first leg on August 13, Ronaldo missed the opening four league games of the season. (La Liga: Real Madrid stung by Espanyol as Moreno strikes in last minute)</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">In that spell, Real secured victories over Deportivo La Coruna and Real Sociedad but drew at home to Levante and Valencia in the kind of tight affairs that Ronaldo would habitually pop up with a goal in.

Real coach Zinedine Zidane omitted the Portuguese from last week's win at Leganes in which Real were less than convincing, needing a 90th minute Sergio Ramos penalty to seal a 3-1 victory.

In the six Liga matches Ronaldo has missed this season, Madrid have claimed 11 points from a possible 18 and they find themselves adrift of the leagues top two.</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">India have been placed in the same group as Rio Olympic silver-medallist Belgium for this year's Hockey Men's World Cup in Bhubaneshwar as the International Hockey Federation (FIH) unveiled the pools and match schedule for the marquee event in Odisha.

India, who last hosted the Hockey World Cup in 2010, will now host the prestigious tournament this year from November 28 to December 16

The 19-day competition will see sixteen of the world's best men's international hockey teams take to the field at the Kalinga Stadium for the coveted trophy.

The 16 teams have been split into four pools of four, with Rio 2016 Olympic champions Argentina competing in Pool A alongside New Zealand, Spain and France, while reigning world champions Australia will take on England, Ireland and China in Pool B.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px">Pool C will see hosts India fight it out with Rio 2016 Olympic silver medallists Belgium, Canada and African continental champions South Africa (15) while European title holders and three-time world champions the Netherlands will take on two-time champions Germany, Malaysia and four-time champions Pakistan in a tough looking Pool D.

India will square off with South Africa in their opening match on November 28, which will be followed by the hosts' clash against Belgium and Canada on December 2 and December 8, respectively.

A first-place finish in each pool will guarantee a berth in the quarter-finals, with the second and third place finishers in each pool needing to win a cross-over match, which will be played on December 10 and December 11, in order to reach the last eight. The last-eight matches will take place on December 12 and December 13.

Meanwhile, the semi-finals will be played on December 15, with the bronze medal and the showpiece final scheduled to be held on December 16.</p>
